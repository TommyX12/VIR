![travis badge](https://travis-ci.com/TommyX12/VIR.svg?branch=master)

**VIR** is an open-source intelligent time-management tool designed to tame the
stress. By simply listing your tasks and schedules, VIR can automatically
generate plans around your available time, and alert you of potential conflicts,
so you'll never have to worry about unrealistic deadlines or todo-list overload.
